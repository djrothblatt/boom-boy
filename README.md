# Boom Boy #

[Live](https://danielrothblatt.me/boom-boy)

## Instructions ##

Player 1 (white): Move with WASD, drop bombs with F.
Player 2 (black): Move with IJKL, drop bombs with H.

The goal is to be the last boom boy standing. You work towards this
goal by blowing up your enemies with your bombs. Bombs will explode on
their own shortly after you plant them. Be sure you don't blow
yourself up!

If a bomb is in your way, you can't walk through it or move it--so be
careful! Don't let anybody trap you.

Stages have two kinds of obstacles, bricks and pillars. Explosions
can destroy bricks, but not pillars.
