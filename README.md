## Instructions
Player 1: Move with arrow keys, drop bombs with '/'.
Player 2: Move with WASD, drop bombs ' ' (space bar).

The goal is to be the last boom boy standing. If you get caught in the
blast when a bomb explodes, you'll disappear, so watch out!
Explosions will destroy some obstacles (bricks, but not pillars). But
you can't walk through bombs, so be careful!
