# Boom Boy

[Live](https://danielrothblatt.me/boom-boy)

## Instructions
Player 1 (white): Move with WASD, drop bombs with F.  
Player 2 (black): Move with IJKL, drop bombs with H.

The goal is to be the last boom boy standing. If you get caught in the
blast when a bomb explodes, you'll disappear, so watch out!
Explosions will destroy some obstacles (bricks, but not pillars). But
you can't walk through bombs, so be careful!
